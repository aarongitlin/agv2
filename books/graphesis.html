<h1>Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production</h1>
<p>One of the more academic books in my list, this is not an easy read for those not steeped in the language of semiotics and media theory. Like most practitioners I know, I have only a tenuous grasp on some of this language, which made reading this book a challenge. However, I still found value in Drucker's humanist analysis of "informational visualizations" â€“ her term for what most practitioners might call UI.

The first chapter is dedicated to a history of visual respresntations of data, which makes this book valuable in and of itself. For example, she provides some examples of the development of plotting data on a grid, from a 10th Century diagram of planetary movement, to Descartes' analytical geometry. I only wish the imagery was larger and of higher quality, as those provided are too small to serve as much more than thumbnails.

Her primary concern is that of interpretation. Visualizations, especially contemporary interactive ones, are distributed as presentations of data, devoid of any subjectivity or opinions. But they are, in fact, interpretations that make countless decidions on what to show, when, and how. While the subjectivity itself is nothing new, the ubiquity and power of the tools is at a scale not previously known to man. 

Think about Google Maps. How does it calculate your routes? Pick the best one? Why do some businesses show and hide as you move the map? We rely on the application's decisions daily, but there is no way to learn its mechanisms. Though not mentioned in the book, star ratings would be equally fascinating to dissect in Drucker's language of interpretation, meaning, and obfuscation. 

There are some ironies to this book, including a lack of any digital presence. Its author wishes for more access to the underlying systems to better understand tools' interpretations, and is published as part of Harvard's metaLab, a studio/lab dedicated to exploring the digital humanities. A print-only publication written in language accessible only to academics does not feel in the right spirit, though I believe the intentions of the author are true and I am glad for her contribution.</p>
