<h1>Thinking Fast and Slow</h1>
<p>Kahneman explains much of human behavior as a dialog between System 1 and System 2. System 1 represents our instincts and immediate (fast thinking) reactions, responses that have evolved over millenia. System 2 is our conscious and thoughtful behavior, our logic and reasoning (slow thinking). We think of ourselves as rational creatures, more System 2 than 1. However, not only is the inverse demonstrably true, our System 2 even serves to defend our automatic System 1 responses, rather than truly analyze them.

The bad news is that our fast-thinking instincts are full of bias and are generally easy to manipulate. What’s worse is that our slow-thinking mind often finds rational-sounding stories to justify biased conclusions.

The good news is that we can train System 2 to be more aware of these biases and learn to spot the difference between justifying a quick conclusion and truly analyzing a situation. Kahneman lays out the theories and research on how we create and enforce these biases and examples of how they may come up in our day to day life.

How I see this as a UX practitioner: as product designers (by which I mean anyone who is making a product, including managers and developers), we are imprinting a part of ourselves onto our "users" (human beings). If we create and release our products quickly and without much thought, then we are imprinting a very large and unfiltered part of ourselves (let's call this Fast Work). If we slow down, do the research, collaborate across disciplines, release, analyze, and iterate based on quantitative and qualitative feedback, then our imprint is greatly diluted, though of course still present (Slow Work). 

There is nothing wrong with Fast work, just as we cannot live without our Fast Thinking System 1. But just as Kahneman suggests we be more conscious of the pitfalls of this mode of thinking, I believe we must also understand the risk of doing Fast Work, especially at scale. No amount of experience, intuition or intelligence can replace the value of Slow Work.</p>
