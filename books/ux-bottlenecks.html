<h1>Bottlenecks: Aligning UX Design with User Psychology</h1>
<p>It feels as though this book has flown under the radar compared to other more popular books about psychology and design, like "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Understanding-Interface-Guidelines/dp/0124079148" target="_blank"> Designing with the Mind in Mind</a>" and "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Things-Designer-People-Voices-Matter/dp/0321767535" target="_blank">100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know about Design</a>." Similar to <italic>Designing with the Mind in Mind</italic>, Evans uses extablished psychological theories as a foundation to discuss design best practices.

The key difference between those books and this one is its focus on design in the context of business, and not simply task comprehension and completion. I have to admit that at times I found the book shocking in its directness of how to utilize weaknesses in human behavior for the purposes of monetization. For example, it barely acknowledges any ethical considerations while reviewing the success of ads that mimic almost exactly organic content, instead leaving the resulting increase in clicks as the barometer of morality. I don't believe that this is an inherently evil practice, but I would hope that his thinking is more nuanced than "more clicks = good."

But that said, I strongly recommend this book for any designer working within a business, and especially ones working within an e-commerce or ads-based model. The main reason I propose designers should read this is that Evans is simply using the language of modern business, psychology, and product management. Those who receive formal design training learn about psychology as well, but usually in the form of visual Gestalt principles, or possibly theories about short and long term memory and multitasking if they study UX or usability. But the direct connection to some of these same principles and digital monetization is left to marketers and business students.

I believe this puts designers, and users, at a disadvantage. Maybe we feel uncomfortable implementing a feature that feels disingenuous, but we lack the language to discuss it from either a business or psychological perspective. And perhaps most unfortunately, we are reduced in our ability to provide alternatives that could be more positive to both the user experience and the business.

In the end, I will follow Evans' lead and leave the complex subject of ethics out of this. Learn how your colleagues and employers think. Learn what they learned. Understand their point of view. Then, if they present a direction you disagree with, you will have the tools to have a balanced and meaningful conversation. You may not be able to set the organization's line of right and wrong, but you will be an informed part of the conversation.</p>
