    title: Thinking Fast and Slow
    author: Daniel Kahneman
    tags:

      - Psychology
    short_description: >-
      Kahneman explains much of human behavior as a dialog between System 1 and System 2. System 1 represents our instincts and immediate (fast thinking) reactions, responses that have evolved over millenia. System 2 is our conscious and thoughtful behavior, our logic and reasoning (slow thinking). We think of ourselves as rational creatures, more System 2 than 1. However, not only is the inverse demonstrably true, our System 2 even serves to defend our automatic System 1 responses, rather than truly analyze them.


      The bad news is that our fast-thinking instincts are full of bias and are generally easy to manipulate. What’s worse is that our slow-thinking mind often finds rational-sounding stories to justify biased conclusions.


      The good news is that we can train System 2 to be more aware of these biases and learn to spot the difference between justifying a quick conclusion and truly analyzing a situation.

    short_description: 
      A short, simple summary of some basic UX research principles. Its main argument is that "research" is really just critical thinking by another name, and that projects of any size benefit from at least some research. The book is such a short and easy read with so many good foundations, I easily recommend it to any novice to intermediate.
