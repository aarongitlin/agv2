Thinking Fast and Slow
</div>
<div class='book-hero__author'>Daniel Kahneman</div>
<div class='book-hero__short-description'>Kahneman explains much of human behavior as a dialog between System 1 and System 2. System 1 represents our instincts and immediate (fast thinking) reactions, responses that have evolved over millenia. System 2 is our conscious and thoughtful behavior, our logic and reasoning (slow thinking). We think of ourselves as rational creatures, more System 2 than 1. However, not only is the inverse demonstrably true, our System 2 even serves to defend our automatic System 1 responses, rather than truly analyze them.

The bad news is that our fast-thinking instincts are full of bias and are generally easy to manipulate. What’s worse is that our slow-thinking mind often finds rational-sounding stories to justify biased conclusions.

The good news is that we can train System 2 to be more aware of these biases and learn to spot the difference between justifying a quick conclusion and truly analyzing a situation. Kahneman lays out the theories and research on how we create and enforce these biases and examples of how they may come up in our day to day life.

How I see this as a UX practitioner: as product designers (by which I mean anyone who is making a product, including managers and developers), we are imprinting a part of ourselves onto our "users" (human beings). If we create and release our products quickly and without much thought, then we are imprinting a very large and unfiltered part of ourselves (let's call this Fast Work). If we slow down, do the research, collaborate across disciplines, release, analyze, and iterate based on quantitative and qualitative feedback, then our imprint is greatly diluted, though of course still present (Slow Work). 

There is nothing wrong with Fast work, just as we cannot live without our Fast Thinking System 1. But just as Kahneman suggests we be more conscious of the pitfalls of this mode of thinking, I believe we must also understand the risk of doing Fast Work, especially at scale. No amount of experience, intuition or intelligence can replace the value of Slow Work.</div>

<div class='overlay__modal__book-description'>A short, simple summary of some basic UX research principles. Its main argument is that 'research' is really just critical thinking by another name, and that projects of any size benefit from its practice. Some of the main challenges standing in our way aren't necessarily time or resources, since some research does not require much of these at all. Rather it is our own human foibles that are usually holding us back:

Politics - your boss or the board has chosen a direction, strategy or approach. Who are you to question it? Do you feel comfortable sharing differing results?

Insecurity - I'm a designer with years of experience. Shouldn't I know what is the best approach? Why do you need a survey and usability test?

Laziness - To be blunt, it is easier to work with the above currents, rather than against them. Solutions from above or those available on blogs or popular websites represent easy outs.

I still reference this book at times for short and informative reasoning on what kind of research is appropriate for what kind of problems. This should for sure be on every UX Designer's shelf, and even for professional researchers it can help provide language to communicate with your peers</div>

<div class='overlay__modal__book-description'>"The quest for good explanations is, I believe, the basic regulating principle not only of science, but of the Enlightenment generally." Deutsch spends some time defining science and progress beyond the tenents of experimentation and observation. Stringent experimentation may help us evaluate the strength of an explanation, but more casual tests may actually reinforce bad explanations by providing "evidence." A good explanation reaches well beyond our own experience, and the better it is the more universally it holds true.

Science without explanations – reporting numbers and variations without attributing any possible causes, is "science in form only." The more unexpected the numbers, the more exciting the results. But without an explanation, this form of "bad philosophy" allows no room for growth, failure, even true discussion. But good philosophy, science with explanations, allows others to continue the conversation, to stretch or break it to the limits of our current ability. The formulation of these explanations and our willingness to test, amend, accept, or replace them is the beginning of infinity.

There is a lot to this book, but I'd suggest that everyone working in tech would benefit from a critical analysis of our own forms of testing and knowledge production.</div>

<div class='overlay__modal__title'>Experience Required: How to become a UX leader regardless of your role</div>
<a class='overlay__modal__manual_close' href='#_'>close</a>
</div>
<div class='overlay__modal__book-description'>Hoekman has a range of platitudes that speak to leadership within organizations generally, and to UX practitioners specifically. He also provides some helpful definitions for terms that we use and misuse every day. Some I noted – 
"UX is the application of psychology to the design of technology." (I liked thinking about how this could translate to other disciplines. Is Product Management the application of business to technology?) "Design is the application of psychology." "Process is crap." "The result of design is communication." You get the idea.

One of the things that stuck with me is the range of competency we can experience in a skill. Unconscious Incompetence -> Conscious Incompetence -> Conscious Competence -> Mastery. He attributes this to Harry Max, one his UX leader peers. We start off not knowing what is good or bad, then developing enough taste to realize our own flaws. We then understand how, with conscious thought, to create good work until the point when we are skilled and experienced enough to create good work with barely any conscious thought given to the practice. 

This book felt like a collection of well written Medium articles on a subject that not enough UX professionals right about – how to be real leaders within an organization.</div>

<a class='overlay__modal__manual_close' href='#_'>close</a>
</div>
<div class='overlay__modal__book-description'>One of the more academic books in my list, this is not an easy read for those not steeped in the language of semiotics and media theory. Like most practitioners I know, I have only a tenuous grasp on some of this language, which made reading this book a challenge. However, I still found value in Drucker's humanist analysis of "informational visualizations" – her term for what most practitioners might call UI.

The first chapter is dedicated to a history of visual respresntations of data, which makes this book valuable in and of itself. For example, she provides some examples of the development of plotting data on a grid, from a 10th Century diagram of planetary movement, to Descartes' analytical geometry. I only wish the imagery was larger and of higher quality, as those provided are too small to serve as much more than thumbnails.

Her primary concern is that of interpretation. Visualizations, especially contemporary interactive ones, are distributed as presentations of data, devoid of any subjectivity or opinions. But they are, in fact, interpretations that make countless decidions on what to show, when, and how. While the subjectivity itself is nothing new, the ubiquity and power of the tools is at a scale not previously known to man. 

Think about Google Maps. How does it calculate your routes? Pick the best one? Why do some businesses show and hide as you move the map? We rely on the application's decisions daily, but there is no way to learn its mechanisms. Though not mentioned in the book, star ratings would be equally fascinating to dissect in Drucker's language of interpretation, meaning, and obfuscation. 

There are some ironies to this book, including a lack of any digital presence. Its author wishes for more access to the underlying systems to better understand tools' interpretations, and is published as part of Harvard's metaLab, a studio/lab dedicated to exploring the digital humanities. A print-only publication written in language accessible only to academics does not feel in the right spirit, though I believe the intentions of the author are true and I am glad for her contribution.</div>

<div class='overlay__modal__title'>UX Strategy: How to Devise Innovative Digital Products that People Want</div>
<a class='overlay__modal__manual_close' href='#_'>close</a>
</div>
<div class='overlay__modal__book-description'>I love this book. It's geared somewhat closer to early to mid level practitioners, but I think holds universal value as a clear articulation of the value and practice of UX in the context of business. Early in the book she mentions that it is sadly common how often UX practitioners are isolated from business strategy, making it challenging to form a cohesive system that works for both users and for the organization. 

Levy provides a framework for practitioners to dig deep into the questions of "why" and "what" well before digging into the "how", the typical domain of designers. The four tenets she proposes are:

- <strong>Business Strategy</strong>
- <strong>Value Innovation</strong>
- <strong>Validated User Research</strong>
- <strong>Killer UX</strong>

I believe most UX professionals are well practiced in the last tenet, familiar with the third, and probably aware of, if not involved in, the first. Business Strategy is how the idea will eventually generate revenue by serving customers, and is exemplifed by the <a href="https://www.alexandercowan.com/business-model-canvas-templates/" target="_blank"> Business Model Canvas</a>. Value Innovation is figuring out what exactly it is that your product does for customers that they previously could not do, and how it provides these services at lower costs than the products customers were familiar with. 

I think the book downplays the impact of brand and emotion on people's decision-making, but Levy uses the language of modern businesses, and if UX professionals want to better communicate with their business-minded stakeholders, then we must learn that language.</div>

<a class='overlay__modal__manual_close' href='#_'>close</a>
</div>
<div class='overlay__modal__book-description'>This book was integral to getting started on my path to understanding the role of UX in data-focused organizations. If you're not deeply familiar with statistics and the best practices of AB testing, it is easy for me to recommend this book. I've <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/becoming-a-data-aware-designer-1d7614ebc3ed" target="_blank">written about my learnings</a> from this book, and how I took it into my own design practice while working at Paperless Post.

If there's one thing I would communicate in brief, it's the distinction between being data-driven and data-informed. Letting yourself be data-driven gives you a scientific process and a quantitative decision making framework, but it quickly boils down to minor iterations and tweaks. Data-informed design on the other hand, sacrifices some of that rigidity and pure statistics in order to allow for other kinds of inputs and broader explorations. The authors show us the statistical best practices to bring into design thinking, and how to communicate with our more data-driven colleagues.</div>

</div>
<div class='overlay__modal__book-description'>I listened to Abby Covert speak at an event in New York a while ago and was so impressed with her and her book that I bought it on the spot. The book is an informal, light, and short collection of different ways to communicate information and flows. While the examples are lightly weighted towards people who work in service or product design, I actually think Covert's breakdowns are approachable enough that basically anyone who has to put presentations together at work may benefit from reading it. 

For example, below are 3 small doodles interspersed with her text as quick examples of communicating a <strong>journey</strong>, a <strong>structure</strong>, and a <strong>system</strong>.
<div class="image-wrapper medium image-three-across">
  <img src="../images/books/mess__journey.jpg" />
  <img src="../images/books/mess__structure.jpg" />
  <img src="../images/books/mess__system.jpg" />
</div>
Covert goes well beyond diagrams. She tackles content strategy, taxonomy, research methods, and analysis. Perhaps my favorite is how she pre and endcaps the book, discussing intent, realities, constraints, and adjusting. If you work in at all complex organization, the following passage may ring true:

<blockquote>No matter what the mess is made of, we have many masters, versions of reality, and needs to serve. Information is full of history and preconceptions. 

Stakeholders need to:  
Know where the project is headed See patterns and potential outcomes 
Frame the appropriate solution for users.

Users need to:   
Know how to get around 
Have a sense of what's possible based on their needs and expectations 
Understand the intended meaning 

It's our job to uncover subjective reality. An important part of that is identifying the differences between what stakeholders think users need and what users think they need for themselves.</blockquote>

If you can't tell, this is one of my favorites. I believe that it's simple and clear tone makes it a valuable read even for experts who may have all these tools under their belt, but may not necessarily be able to explain them to non-experts. </div>

<a class='overlay__modal__manual_close' href='#_'>close</a>
</div>
<div class='overlay__modal__book-description'>It feels as though this book has flown under the radar compared to other more popular books about psychology and design, like "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Understanding-Interface-Guidelines/dp/0124079148" target="_blank"> Designing with the Mind in Mind</a>" and "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Things-Designer-People-Voices-Matter/dp/0321767535" target="_blank">100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know about Design</a>." Similar to <italic>Designing with the Mind in Mind</italic>, Evans uses extablished psychological theories as a foundation to discuss design best practices.

The key difference between those books and this one is its focus on design in the context of business, and not simply task comprehension and completion. I have to admit that at times I found the book shocking in its directness of how to utilize weaknesses in human behavior for the purposes of monetization. For example, it barely acknowledges any ethical considerations while reviewing the success of ads that mimic almost exactly organic content, instead leaving the resulting increase in clicks as the barometer of morality. I don't believe that this is an inherently evil practice, but I would hope that his thinking is more nuanced than "more clicks = good."

But that said, I strongly recommend this book for any designer working within a business, and especially ones working within an e-commerce or ads-based model. The main reason I propose designers should read this is that Evans is simply using the language of modern business, psychology, and product management. Those who receive formal design training learn about psychology as well, but usually in the form of visual Gestalt principles, or possibly theories about short and long term memory and multitasking if they study UX or usability. But the direct connection to some of these same principles and digital monetization is left to marketers and business students.

I believe this puts designers, and users, at a disadvantage. Maybe we feel uncomfortable implementing a feature that feels disingenuous, but we lack the language to discuss it from either a business or psychological perspective. And perhaps most unfortunately, we are reduced in our ability to provide alternatives that could be more positive to both the user experience and the business.

In the end, I will follow Evans' lead and leave the complex subject of ethics out of this. Learn how your colleagues and employers think. Learn what they learned. Understand their point of view. Then, if they present a direction you disagree with, you will have the tools to have a balanced and meaningful conversation. You may not be able to set the organization's line of right and wrong, but you will be an informed part of the conversation.</div>
