I have been a practicing designer since 2010. An undergraduate degree in fine art, a teaching stint in Japan and a graduate degree of design in Australia have brought me around the world. In 2014 I returned to my city of origin, New York, as a Senior Experience Designer at global digital agency [Tigerspike](http://www.tigerspike.com).

A visual designer by training, my focus since 2012 has been on designing patterns and systems for medium to large applications and websites. While I receive a great deal of inspiration from contemporaries such as [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com) and [Anna Debenham](http://maban.co.uk/), my tradional Graphic Design training has also exposed me to systems outside of a digital context. You can read more about my obsession with systems on Tigerspike’s blog as well as my own.

I currently live in Ridgewood, Queens. I love beautiful and functional design, and nerdy conversations about how functional design is it's own kind of beauty. I also love dogs shaped like hot dogs. A lot.
