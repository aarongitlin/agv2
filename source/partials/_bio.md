I have been a practicing designer since 2010. An undergraduate degree in fine art, a teaching stint in Japan, and a graduate degree of design in Australia have brought me around the world. In 2014, I returned to my city of origin, New York, as a Senior Experience Designer at global digital agency [Tigerspike](http://www.tigerspike.com).

A visual designer by training, my focus since 2012 has been on designing patterns and systems for medium to large applications and websites. While I receive a great deal of inspiration from contemporaries such as [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com) and [Anna Debenham](http://maban.co.uk/), my tradional Graphic Design training has also exposed me to systems outside of a digital context. You can read more about my obsession with systems on [Tigerspike’s blog](http://tigerspike.com/en/resources/entry/1100469/the-iphone-6-is-here-and-you-need-a-design-system) as well as [my own](http://aarongitlin.com/writings/systems.html).

I currently live in Ridgewood, Queens. I love beautiful and functional design, and nerdy conversations about how beauty itself can be derived from function. I also love dogs shaped like hot dogs. A lot.
