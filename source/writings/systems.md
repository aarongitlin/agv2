The concept of design systems has gained a lot of popularity recently in the field of digital design. Check out [this list](http://styleguides.io/) to see a large collection of articles and resources that discuss design systems and their common form of documentation: the style guide. This style guide is sometimes called a "living" style guide, implying that it is periodically updated and maintained, and not just a static tome. 

I have yet to meet a design professonal working in the space right now that rejects the value of a design system and a living style guide. Some very prominent companies have some really inspirational guides publicly accessible, and likely there are many more amazing ones behind closed doors. But anyone who has attempted such an undertaking knows that the cost is high. Designers design, coders code, clients or directors ask for changes, due dates loom. Changes go through that don't get completely documented. Sometimes a new text style is introduced, maybe on purpose, maybe by accident. 

A poorly maintained style guide is, obviously, of lesser value than a maintained one. But it can also be of _negative_ value, directing designers or developers to work with patterns and code that are no longer valid. Imagine trying to put your Ikea furniture together using the instructions to a different, but not entirely dissimilar product. There may be some insights in those diagrams, but what seems useful at first may actually drag you down the completely wrong path. 

So style guides are hard to maintain, and a poorly maintained one may actually _hurt_ the project/product. It might be logical to ask, "is it worth it"? And while it pains me to say this, I do not believe the answer is an unequivocal "yes". It really depends on the product being designed, and how alive it is intended to be. Will it
