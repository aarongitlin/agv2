todos:
- fix captions and pictures on dtv case study
- finish writing Systems post
- fix bottom spacing on bio
- consider mvp plan:
1. no nav, just actions on top bar
2. put all case studies and writings on home page
3. get rid of footer

- consider future plan, if/when many studies or writings
1. just a few on home, link to view all
2. put nav back in.
3. maybe have intro back on left, content on right. or make intro smaller

consider a doodling style for writings to add consistency/theme

potential future posts:
processes(waterfall, agile, retainer)

approach to design (circular, not stepped) stepping back, bigger picture, analogy to sketching

should designers code (duh)
