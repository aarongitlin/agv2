        <div class='article__content-wrapper'>
          <p>I built my first personal website in 2011-2012 using Wordpress, blood, sweat, and tears. For now I’ll keep it live at <a href="http://lovesyoudesign.com/">www.lovesyoudesign.com</a>, though perhaps I will archive it at some point. The site is called Loves You Design because that was the name I contracted my design services under for a time. I was inspired by a conversation with a friend after I mentioned I loved the design of something. She responded, “Aaron, the design loves you.” I also happen to be obsessed with the Beach Boys, who just happen to have an album titled “Loves You”, with an amazing album cover.</p>
        
          <p>The album cover seems inspired by cross-stitching embroidery patterns, and has a homey and old-fashioned feel to it. The music in the album was actually quite a departure for the band, using synthesizers and embracing Brian Wilson’s by-then terrible voice. I love the contrast of old and new, and wanted to bring that into my own visual identity. As a digital designer I felt the most appropriate analogy was for me to embrace the pixel. Funny enough cross-stitching and pixels look pretty similar, so there is actual visual continuity between my approach and the original inspiration.</p>
        
          <p>I built the site as a portfolio for my graphic design business. I now identify as an <strong>Experience Designer</strong> (or product designer, or UI designer, or UI/UX designer, or whatever your organization happens to call it). I also have the term “senior” in front of my job title at work, which means I have quite a lot of responsibility outside of design execution. I’ve hired and now manage new designers, I plan projects, review work, estimate, present to clients, and all that other fun stuff. I also tend to work on large and long-term projects with large teams. A short write-up and an image gallery were no longer the best way to show my work.</p>
        
          <p>I wanted to keep the process of creating my new site informal, but I did write down a few requirements:</p>
        
          <ol>
            <li>No more wordpress (too complicated, insecure, hard to play with sometimes)</li>
            <li>Prefer to write in markdown (easy to apply basic html styles without getting bogged down by a WYSWYG)</li>
            <li>Simple administration and deployment with full control (Don’t want to use a lot of plugins, but occasionally try out a few code experiments on my own).</li>
            <li>Responsive (duh)</li>
            <li>Emphasize long-form content with accompanying visuals</li>
            <li>A new and much simpler look, but with some continuity from the original site.</li>
          </ol>

          I experimented with Github’s <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and while I got up and running quickly, I found learning a new templating language and structure time consuming. So I switched over to <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>, a static site generator that I had already used in the past. I was concerned that it’s blog was under-featured compared to Jekyll’s, but that turned out not to be the case. The Middleman-blog extension did absolutely everything I needed, and took almost no time to set up.

          <p>I created two blogs, which only requires a simple set up in your config.rb:</p>
        
          <pre><code>          activate :blog do |blog|
            #set options on blog
            blog.name = “projects”
            blog.prefix = “/projects”
            blog.layout = “project_layout”
            blog.permalink = “/{title}.html”
            blog.sources = “/{title}.html”
            blog.default_extension = “.md”
            blog.paginate = true
          end
        
          activate :blog do |blog|
            # set options on blog
            blog.name = “writings”
            blog.prefix = “/writings”
            blog.layout = “writing_layout”
            blog.permalink = “/{title}.html”
            blog.sources = “/{title}.html”
            blog.default_extension = “.md”
            blog.paginate = true
          end
          </code></pre>
        
          <p>And there you go! I now have two blogs that I can call on separately: one for writing and one for projects. All you have to do now is put some markdown files into the appropriately named folders, "projects" and "writings" in my case.</p>
        
          <p>One of the reasons I love Middleman is that I can easily use front end development tools like SASS and HAML, and two of my best friends: <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> and <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Neat</a> from the guys at Thoughtbot. I've long favored this toolkit over something like Bootstrap or Foundation (which are both amazing and inspirational), because I find it strikes a good balance between being flexible around my design/code decisions and being rigid enough to force me to keep my code tidy and logical.</p>
        
          <p>Using Neat I find it best not to design layouts based on breakpoints, but components themselves. Using a mobile first approach I lay out the components more or less stacked on top of each other. As the browser stretches out, I decide what elements would benefit from a new treatment. Because the site is so simple, there's not <em>too</em> much work that needs to be done in this regard.</p>

          So back to requirements. I've checked off 1 through 4 with my development environment, especially with the help of this <a href="https://github.com/edgecase/middleman-gh-pages">trusty little gem</a> that lets me easily deploy my site to Github pages, where it is currently being hosted.</p>

          <p>I worked with the type size, spacing, and alignment to encourage easy reading, and pushed out of the grid at times to let the imagery breathe. I settled on <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/source-sans-pro">Source Sans</a> and <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/source-serif-pro">Source Serif</a> hosted by Typekit, primarily because it is a highly legible and open source font, but also because I appreciate it's close historical reference and smart modern adaptation. I felt it fit with that whole "old &amp; new" concept I briefly described at the beginning of this article.</p>
        
          <p>I decided to keep the pixel font as a special header. It's not "pretty", but by using it for my name and the case study titles, I help these items stand out and separate it from the other content on the site. It also allows for some continuity from my old site, which was important for me. I also paired the pixel type face with pixelated emojis that corresponded to the projects in some way. I felt this added some humor and interest to the home page, and encouraged engagement in a way that I felt logos or screenshots could not do.</p>
        
          <p>Three case studies, two blog posts, and a couple of emoji later I have my first new personal website in about four years. My goals for the next few months include continuing writing, adding one more case study, and introducing a few visual enhancements (animations, transitions, etc).</p>
